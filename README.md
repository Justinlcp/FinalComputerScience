Project Overview

This project is an academic management system developed entirely as the final project for the class Introduction to Programming at College Vanier. The system kind of models a school environment: students are associated with their department, can register for courses, complete assignments and receive grade. 
The project focuses on applying many things we learned this semester such asclass design, data validation, method creating and unit testing. 
It is built using Java code, Maven, lombok and JUnit 5.
